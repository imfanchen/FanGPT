       "To solve the problem of finding two indices in an array such that their corresponding values add up to a given target, we can use a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the numbers we have seen so far and their respective indices. This approach allows us to achieve an O(n) time complexity solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a step-by-step explanation and the corresponding code:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialize a dictionary**: This will store the numbers we have seen so far and their indices.\n",
       "2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number, calculate the complement that would be needed to reach the target (i.e., `target - num`).\n",

       "   - If it is not, add the current number and its index to the dictionary.\n",

       "def twoSum(nums, target):\n",

       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Dictionary Initialization**: `num_to_index = {}` initializes an empty dictionary to store numbers as keys and their indices as values.\n",
       "2. **Loop Through the Array**: `for index, num in enumerate(nums):` iterates over the array with both the index and the value.\n",
       "3. **Calculate Complement**: `complement = target - num` calculates the number needed to reach the target.\n",
       "4. **Check Dictionary**: `if complement in num_to_index:` checks if the complement is already in the dictionary.\n",
       "   - If it is, `return [num_to_index[complement], index]` returns the indices of the two numbers.\n",
       "   - If it is not, `num_to_index[num] = index` adds the current number and its index to the dictionary.\n",
