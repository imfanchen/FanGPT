Victor arrives at Ingolstadt at age 17 to begin his studies.\\n\\n2. He meets his first professor, M. Krempe, who harshly criticizes Victor\\'s interest in alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa, calling such studies worthless and outdated.\\n\\n3. Victor then meets Professor M. Waldman, who has a much more encouraging and gentle approach. Unlike Krempe, Waldman acknowledges the contributions of the ancient alchemists while explaining how modern science has advanced beyond them.\\n\\n4. Waldman\\'s lecture inspires Victor, particularly when he speaks about how modern scientists have acquired \"almost unlimited powers\" and can \"command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world.\"\\n\\n5. Victor becomes deeply devoted to his studies, particularly chemistry and other branches of natural philosophy (science). He excels in his work and makes rapid progress, even making improvements to some scientific instruments that earn him praise at the university.\\n\\n6. By the end of two years at Ingolstadt, Victor has become fascinated with the principle of life - how it is created and how it might be bestowed upon lifeless matter. This marks the beginning of his obsession that will eventually lead to the creation of his monster.\\n\\nThe chapter is significant as it shows Victor\\'s transition from outdated alchemical interests to modern scientific pursuits, and plants the seeds for his eventual tragic experiment in creating life.', type='text')]\n"
