  "summary": "The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) is a new byte-level LLM architecture that matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale while improving inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, allocating more compute to complex data. The model achieves training flop-controlled parity with Llama 3 while using up to 50% fewer flops at inference.",
